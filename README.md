# Zillow's Home Value Prediction

Zillow is the leading real estate and rental marketplace dedicated to empowering consumers with full lifecycle of owning and living in a home- including homes for sale, homes for rent and homes not currently on the market, as well as Zestimate home values, Rent Zestimates and other home-related information. 
The Zestimate was created to give consumers as much information as possible about homes and the housing market, marking the first-time consumers had access to this type of home value information at no cost. “Zestimates” are estimated home values based on 7.5 million statistical and machine learning models that analyze hundreds of data points on each property. 

The Main objective of this research project is to use different algorithms to make predictions about the future sale prices of homes, to reduce the error margin and increase the accuracy of Zestimate to get an exact valuation of homes.
